This SDK does not yet cover 100% of GraphAPI's functionality and will need to be expanded as new requirement arise. If you have one of these new requirements you can either create a new [issue](https://github.com/Future-Secure-AI/microsoft-graph/issues) and the desired requirement will be addressed in order of priority OR feel free to raise a pull request adding the functionality yourself. If you take the latter path make sure you strictly follow the existing patterns set. It's super important that new functionality follows the established patterns so the team knows how to expect the functionality to operate.
